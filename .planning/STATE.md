## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: TDD approach — public repo means code quality is visible, prevents regressions
- [Init]: Three flagship services (Pentest, Assessment, Custom Tooling) — clear positioning, training secondary
- [Init]: Book a Consultation as primary CTA — qualifies leads through conversation
- [Phase 01]: Pinned @eslint/js to ^9 to match eslint ^9 peer dependency (eslint 10 compat unverified for eslint-plugin-astro)
- [Phase 01 P02]: Shared loadJsPDF in quiz/pdf.ts imported by resources.ts (eliminates duplication)
- [Phase 01 P02]: Cookie consent uses ANALYTICS import from @/data/site instead of define:vars pattern
- [Phase 01 P03]: Pre-commit hook runs typecheck + test on full codebase, lint-staged on staged files only
- [Phase 01 P03]: Cookie settings button wired to extracted module (deviation fix)
- [Phase 03]: Design tokens added inside existing :root block — no renames, no removals of existing tokens
- [Phase 03]: Mobile CTA placed in nav-end outside hamburger menu with 44px min-height touch target
- [Phase 03]: E2E test stubs use test.fixme() to track without blocking builds
- [Phase 03]: Section order changed: credentials before services per CONTEXT.md locked decision
- [Phase 03]: Hero CTA updated from 'Request a consultation' to 'Book a Consultation' per UI-SPEC
- [Phase 03]: Global shared CSS stays in global.css; section-specific CSS moved to component scoped styles
- [Phase 03 P03]: BlogSection uses dynamic getCollection('blog') instead of hardcoded blogPosts array
- [Phase 03 P03]: FaqSection contains its own faqItems data (component encapsulation)
- [Phase 03 P03]: No CSS removed from global.css to avoid breaking other pages
- [Phase 03 P04]: Font loading reduced from 7 weight files to 3 (Plus Jakarta Sans 400/700, JetBrains Mono 400)
- [Phase 03 P04]: WhatsApp button inverted sizing: 56px mobile, 48px desktop (Rwanda mobile-first UX)
- [Phase 03 P04]: Hero terminal pushed to order:10 on mobile to keep CTA above the fold
- [Phase 02 P01]: innerHTML already replaced during Phase 1 execution — plan verified pre-existing implementation
- [Phase 02 P01]: ESLint no-restricted-syntax rule with AST selectors catches both assignment and member expression innerHTML patterns
- [Phase 02]: Post-build CSP injection script (inject-csp.mjs) with per-page SHA-256 hashing instead of Astro experimental CSP (not available in Astro 6)
- [Phase 02]: All inline style attributes replaced with CSS classes for CSP style-src compliance (no unsafe-inline)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Resolved]: CSP hash-based approach implemented via post-build inject-csp.mjs script — SHA-256 hashes for inline scripts and styles, no _headers file needed (meta tag approach)
- [Resolved]: eslint-plugin-astro 1.6.0 confirmed compatible with ESLint 9 flat config — working in Plan 01-01
- [Research flag]: BNR directive numbers for service pages must be verified at bnr.rw before publishing in Phase 7
- [Content dependency]: Anonymised case studies (Phase 6) require founder to write from real engagements — not a technical blocker but a content scheduling dependency
