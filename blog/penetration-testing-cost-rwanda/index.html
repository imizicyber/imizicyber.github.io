  <h1>How much does penetration testing cost in Rwanda?</h1>

  <p>It is one of the first questions every organisation asks, and one of the hardest to find a straight answer to. Most security firms in Rwanda and across East Africa do not publish pricing, and for good reason: every engagement is different.</p>

  <p>This guide explains what drives penetration testing costs, what you should expect from a professional assessment, and how to evaluate proposals so you get real value for your investment.</p>

  <h2>What determines the cost?</h2>
  <p>Penetration testing is not a commodity. It is a professional service performed by certified security consultants who simulate real attacks against your systems. The price of an engagement is shaped by several factors:</p>

  <div class="scope-table">
    <div class="scope-row header">
      <div class="scope-cell">FACTOR</div>
      <div class="scope-cell">IMPACT ON COST</div>
      <div class="scope-cell">WHY IT MATTERS</div>
    </div>
    <div class="scope-row">
      <div class="scope-cell">Scope</div>
      <div class="scope-cell">High</div>
      <div class="scope-cell">A single web app is far less effort than a full assessment covering web, mobile, APIs, USSD, and internal infrastructure. More assets in scope means more testing time.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="scope-row">
      <div class="scope-cell">Application complexity</div>
      <div class="scope-cell">High</div>
      <div class="scope-cell">A core banking platform with hundreds of endpoints, multiple user roles, and transaction processing takes significantly longer to test than a brochure website.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="scope-row">
      <div class="scope-cell">Testing methodology</div>
      <div class="scope-cell">Medium</div>
      <div class="scope-cell">Black box (no credentials) requires more reconnaissance than grey box (credentials provided). Most engagements use grey box for the best balance of realism and coverage.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="scope-row">
      <div class="scope-cell">Consultant expertise</div>
      <div class="scope-cell">High</div>
      <div class="scope-cell">OSCP-certified consultants with red team experience at major financial institutions deliver substantially deeper findings than junior analysts running automated tools.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="scope-row">
      <div class="scope-cell">Compliance mapping</div>
      <div class="scope-cell">Medium</div>
      <div class="scope-cell">Mapping findings to BNR regulations, PCI DSS, or ISO 27001 requires additional analysis and structured reporting beyond a standard technical report.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="scope-row">
      <div class="scope-cell">Deliverables</div>
      <div class="scope-cell">Medium</div>
      <div class="scope-cell">Executive summaries, remediation workshops, board-ready presentations, and retesting all add to the engagement scope and value.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>What should a professional pentest include?</h2>
  <p>Regardless of scope, a legitimate penetration test from a qualified provider should always include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Manual testing by certified consultants</strong> — not just automated scanning. Tools like Nessus and Burp Suite are starting points, not the entire assessment.</li>
    <li><strong>Recognised methodology</strong> — OWASP Testing Guide, PTES, OSSTMM, or NIST SP 800-115. If the provider cannot name their methodology, that is a red flag.</li>
    <li><strong>Executive summary</strong> — a non-technical overview suitable for management and board reporting, with risk ratings and business impact analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Detailed technical report</strong> — every finding documented with CVSS scoring, proof-of-concept evidence, affected assets, and step-by-step remediation guidance.</li>
    <li><strong>Debrief session</strong> — a walkthrough of findings with your technical team to answer questions and prioritise remediation.</li>
    <li><strong>Retest</strong> — after you remediate the findings, the provider should verify the fixes are effective. The best providers include this in the engagement.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>The cheapest option is rarely the best option.</strong> For BNR-regulated financial institutions, a penetration test is not a checkbox exercise. It is how you demonstrate to the regulator — and to your customers — that you take security seriously. An automated scan repackaged as a "pentest report" will not satisfy a competent regulator or protect you from a real attack.
  </div>

  <h2>International firms vs local providers</h2>
  <p>Many Rwandan organisations default to international providers from Europe, the US, or South Africa for their security assessments. These firms deliver quality work, but they come with significant overhead: international travel costs, higher hourly rates, and limited understanding of the local technology landscape.</p>

  <p>A Kigali-based provider with equivalent certifications and experience can deliver the same quality of assessment at a substantially lower cost. The savings come from eliminating travel expenses, lower operational overhead, and deep familiarity with the technologies common in East African financial services — USSD, mobile money platforms, and local banking infrastructure.</p>

  <p>The key is verifying credentials. <strong>OSCP is the industry benchmark</strong> for penetration testing competence. If a provider holds OSCP (or OSCP+) and has demonstrated experience testing financial institutions, the quality of their work should be equivalent regardless of where they are headquartered.</p>

  <h2>How to budget for security testing</h2>
  <p>If you are an IT manager or CISO building a security budget for your organisation in Rwanda, think about penetration testing in tiers:</p>

  <h3>Foundational programme</h3>
  <p>Annual web application and external network testing. This meets basic BNR requirements and gives you visibility into your most exposed attack surface. Suitable for smaller institutions and fintechs with a limited number of customer-facing applications.</p>

  <h3>Recommended programme</h3>
  <p>Quarterly application testing combined with an annual comprehensive assessment that includes internal network, mobile apps, and API testing. This provides continuous visibility and catches new vulnerabilities introduced by development cycles. Suitable for mid-size banks, MFIs, and telecoms.</p>

  <h3>Enterprise programme</h3>
  <p>Continuous testing integrated into your development pipeline, managed vulnerability tracking, quarterly assessments across all assets, and periodic red team exercises. This is the standard for large banks and organisations with complex, constantly evolving environments.</p>

  <p>The right programme depends on your organisation's size, regulatory obligations, and risk appetite. A qualified provider will help you determine the appropriate scope during a scoping consultation — before any commitment.</p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Consider the alternative.</strong> IBM's 2025 Cost of a Data Breach report puts the global average at USD 4.88 million per incident. For financial institutions, the figure is even higher. The cost of regular security testing is a fraction of what a single breach would cost your organisation in financial losses, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage.
  </div>

  <h2>Red flags when evaluating proposals</h2>
  <p>Watch out for these warning signs when comparing penetration testing providers:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Extremely low pricing</strong> — if a quote seems too good to be true, you are almost certainly getting an automated scan report, not a manual security assessment. Real penetration testing requires skilled consultants and time.</li>
    <li><strong>Pricing per vulnerability</strong> — this creates perverse incentives to inflate findings or miss them entirely. Professional engagements are scoped by time and assets, not by findings count.</li>
    <li><strong>No methodology referenced</strong> — legitimate providers reference OWASP, PTES, or OSSTMM. If they cannot explain their testing approach, question the depth of the assessment.</li>
    <li><strong>No sample report available</strong> — if they cannot show you what the deliverable looks like, be cautious about what you will actually receive.</li>
    <li><strong>No recognised certifications</strong> — OSCP, PNPT, CREST, or equivalent hands-on certifications demonstrate that the tester can actually find and exploit vulnerabilities, not just run tools.</li>
    <li><strong>No retest included</strong> — finding vulnerabilities is only half the job. Verifying that fixes work is equally important. Providers who do not offer retesting are leaving the job unfinished.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting a quote</h2>
  <p>To get an accurate, tailored quote from any provider, prepare the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What systems need testing (web apps, APIs, mobile apps, network, USSD, cloud)</li>
    <li>Number of applications and approximate number of pages or endpoints</li>
    <li>Number of user roles per application</li>
    <li>Whether credentials will be provided (grey box vs black box)</li>
    <li>Any compliance requirements (BNR, PCI DSS, ISO 27001)</li>
    <li>Preferred testing window and any blackout periods</li>
    <li>Whether retesting is required after remediation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A qualified provider will review this information and come back with a detailed proposal including scope, methodology, timeline, and fixed pricing — typically within 48 hours.</p>
